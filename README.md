# Bone Fracture Detection using YOLOv8

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based approach to detect bone fractures using the YOLOv8 object detection model. The notebook contains data exploration, model training, evaluation, and predictions on test images.

## Features
- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Training YOLOv8 for fracture detection
- Model evaluation with a Confusion Matrix
- Making predictions on new X-ray images

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd bone-fracture-detection-yolov8
